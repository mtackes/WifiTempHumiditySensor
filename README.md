# Wifi Temp and Humidity Sensor
#### An honors project for Madison College.

Uses an Arduino, wifi module, and temperature/humidity sensor to record data from multiple locations in a household.

The Arduino code relies on two third-party libraries:

- [Sparkfun CC3000 library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SFE_CC3000_Library)
- [Adafruit DHT Sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)

This is a work-in-progress. While the Arduino portion is mostly functional, the server to record and store data is not yet complete.
